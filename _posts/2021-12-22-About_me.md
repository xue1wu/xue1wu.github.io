Hi, this is Xueyi! I am the creator of this website and the paintings. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me and my works.


I love landscape oil painting because I believe that paintings can hold invisible emotions and memories, transporting viewers back to the environments they depict. If my work evokes memories for you, that's wonderful! Capturing and sharing such emotions is a key motivation behind my art.
