Orbitum is a mobile game I played in high school.

I am an ENFJ who loves. 

Green is my color of the year 2022. 

I speak Mandarin, English, and is learning Italian. 

I studied Math becasue topology and geometry is the most pretty Minimalism art. Beyong this, I do not appreciate most Minimalism. I love how the UNC Math Department has a Louise Bourgeois's Spider outside.

I love just being slient and thinking for 20 mins before I actually paint. I embrace the version of myself that occasionally detests what I paint(do), yet persists without giving up halfway. 

Since I am not a academic painter, I would love to hear feedbacks for improvement!
