Dear all, I am in the tree wall passage. A gust of wind embraces you, rustling your clothes and even giving a sensation of being pushed back. Through the floating tree wall cracks ahead, the sandy sunlight filters in. It may not be warm, but there is a comforting scent of plants in the air.

Passing through the passage, there is a tranquil, windless little garden with a tinkling fountain. Is there anyone in the garden? I don't know.

However, red leaves have unexpectedly appeared on the tree wall. Who brought them or where did they come from? Could it be the wind?

The garden after the fierce wind is a memory, a dream, a secret garden of the painter.
