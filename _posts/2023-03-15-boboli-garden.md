After my journey to Florence, Italy, alongside my best friend, I painted this:

A gentle breeze envelops you, caressing your garments and gently nudging you backward. Amidst the cracks in the floating wall of trees, the soft, sandy sunlight filters in, casting a tranquil ambiance. Though the temperature may not be warm, there lingers a soothing scent of blooming flora in the air.

As you traverse the passageway, you stumble upon a serene and windless little garden adorned with a tinkling fountain. Is there someone else present within this haven? That remains uncertain.

However, a surprising array of crimson leaves has inexplicably materialized upon the tree wall. Whence did they originate, and who was responsible? Could it be the whimsical hand of the wind itself?

The garden, transformed by the tempestuous gusts, stands now as a cherished memory, a realm of reverie, a clandestine sanctuary curated by the artist.
